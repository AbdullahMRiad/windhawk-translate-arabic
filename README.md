# Windhawk translation

To translate Windhawk, pick one of the
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files (for example, [en.yml](en.yml)
for English), and translate the text on the right side of the colon.

For example, here's an excerpt from the English translation file:

```yml
app:
  appHeader:
    home: "Home"
    explore: "Explore"
    settings: "Settings"
    about: "About"
```

In this excerpt, the "Home", "Explore", "Settings", and "About" are the strings
that need to be translated.
